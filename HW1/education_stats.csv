SE.XPD.TOTL.GD.ZS,Government expenditure on education as % of GDP (%),"Total general (local, regional and central) government expenditure on education (current, capital, and transfers), expressed as a percentage of GDP. It includes expenditure funded by transfers from international sources to government. Divide total government expenditure for a given level of education (ex. primary, secondary, or all levels combined) by the GDP, and multiply by 100. A higher percentage of GDP spent on education shows a higher government priority for education, but also a higher capacity of the government to raise revenues for public spending, in relation to the size of the country's economy. When interpreting this indicator however, one should keep in mind in some countries, the private sector and/or households may fund a higher proportion of total funding for education, thus making government expenditure appear lower than in other countries.

SE.PRM.ENRR.FE,"Gross enrolment ratio, primary, female (%)",,"Total female enrollment in primary education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the female population of official primary education age. GER can exceed 100% due to the inclusion of over-aged and under-aged students because of early or late school entrance and grade repetition.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics,Primary
SE.ENR.PRIM.FM.ZS,"Gross enrolment ratio, primary, gender parity index (GPI)",,"Ratio of female gross enrolment ratio for primary to male gross enrolment ratio for primary. It is calculated by dividing the female value for the indicator by the male value for the indicator. A GPI equal to 1 indicates parity between females and males. In general, a value less than 1 indicates disparity in favor of males and a value greater than 1 indicates disparity in favor of females.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics,Primary
SE.PRE.NENR.FE,"Net enrolment rate, pre-primary, female (%)",,"Total number of female students in the theoretical age group for pre-primary education enrolled in that level, expressed as a percentage of the total female population in that age group. Divide the number of female students enrolled who are of the official age group for pre-primary education by the female population for the same age group and multiply the result by 100. NER at each level of education should be based on enrolment of the relevant age group in all types of schools and education institutions, including public, private and all other institutions that provide organized educational programmes.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics,Pre-Primary
SE.PRM.NENR.FE,"Net enrolment rate, primary, female (%)",,"Total number of female students in the theoretical age group for primary education enrolled in that level, expressed as a percentage of the total female population in that age group. Divide the number of female students enrolled who are of the official age group for primary education by the female population for the same age group and multiply the result by 100. NER at each level of education should be based on enrolment of the relevant age group in all types of schools and education institutions, including public, private and all other institutions that provide organized educational programmes. A high NER denotes a high degree of coverage for the official school-age population. The theoretical maximum value is 100%. Increasing trends can be considered as reflecting improving coverage at the specified level of education. When the NER is compared with the GER, the difference between the two highlights the incidence of under-aged and over-aged enrolment. If the NER is below 100%, then the complement, i.e. the difference with 100%, provides a measure of the proportion of children not enrolled at the specified level of education. However, since some of these children/youth could be enrolled at other levels of education, this difference should in no way be considered as indicating the percentage of students not enrolled. To measure universal primary education, for example, adjusted primary NER is calculated on the basis of the percentage of children in the official primary school age range who are enrolled in either primary or secondary education. A more precise complementary indicator is the Age-specific enrolment ratio (ASER) which shows the participation in education of the population of each particular age, regardless of the level of education.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics,Primary

SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS,"Primary completion rate, both sexes (%)",,"Total number of new entrants in the last grade of primary education, regardless of age, expressed as percentage of the total population of the theoretical entrance age to the last grade of primary. This indicator is also known as "gross intake rate to the last grade of primary education." The ratio can exceed 100% due to over-aged and under-aged children who enter primary school late/early and/or repeat grades.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics,Primary
