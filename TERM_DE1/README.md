# Submission - European Soccer dataset #

This folder contains all my workfiles used for the [term project](https://github.com/salacika/DE1SQL/tree/master/SQL6#homework) in Data Engineering 1. I set out to build a MySQL schema using the **European Soccer dataset** available on Kaggle - [link](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/home).

###  Operational layer ###


My operational layer consists of [7 tables stored in csv](https://github.com/zsomborh/ba_de1/tree/master/TERM_DE1/data) - all centered around football matches that happened in years: 2008-2016. The below EER diagrams were generated by MySQL - I needed to split my tables to two categories otherwise MySQL crashed due to the high number of columns available in one of my tables. 

1.  Matches in relation to football teams, leagues and the name of the country to which these entities belong:
    * In the **matches** table, every observation is a football match between two teams 
    * **league** table contains the name of 11 European first class soccer leagues
    * **country** table helps identify the name of a Country based on country id in other tables 
    * The **teams** table contains the long and short name of teams
    * **team attributes** table contains a lot of qualitative and quantitative feature of a team in a given date

2.  Players that played in given matches and their attributes:  
    * **players** table contains the birthday, weight and height of a player 
    * **player_attributes** table shows qualitative and quantitative attributes of given player in a given date
